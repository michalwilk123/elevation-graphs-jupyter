# Visualisation of interpolation algorithms
---
#### School project for _Numerical analysis_ subject

This repository contains a jupyter notebook with diffrent visualisations of interpolation algorithms, tested on couple of data samples.

Because of heavy usage of interactive GUI wigdets (ipywidgets) and also map widgets (ipyleaflet), i advise viewing it on a platform 
__binder__. All you need, is to click the above button. After a dozen of second you will be able to play with the notebook in your 
browser without having to install anything.

Or you can just clone the repository and run the notebook on your local machine. 
Then you probably need to install the required dependacies from requirements.txt.
